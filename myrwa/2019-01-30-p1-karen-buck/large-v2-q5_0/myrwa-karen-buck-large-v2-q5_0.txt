 So, when we first started counting herring, so that was 2012, and, you know, the rules
 were a little looser and, you know, you just had to ask permission and you could bring
 some people to observe and see what you're doing.
 So I loaded the car with kids, just my son and a couple of friends, and, you know, I
 baited them with fishing rods because, you know, they wouldn't really want to go see
 fish, but they'd want to go fishing.
 So I had them there and so I did my count and then I, we talked about dams and how they
 are a rude interrupter with, you know, habitats and that type of thing and we just had a great
 discussion about dams and, you know, this one was replaced with a fish ladder which
 allowed the herring to migrate and the eels and whatever snuck in there as well.
 So we had a great time and the next day I get a phone call from the boy's mother and
 she said, "You wouldn't believe it.
 The boys," well, all the sixth graders had their MCAS and the open response question
 was, "Name and describe a man-made structure that interrupts," or they probably didn't
 say interrupt, but that, you know, disturbs the natural ecology.
 And you gave them the answer, Karen!
