00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480
 So when we first started counting herring, so it was 2012, and you know the rules were

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.880
 a little looser and you know you just had to ask permission and you could bring some

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.180
 people to observe and see what you're doing.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.480
 So I loaded the car with kids, just my son and a couple of friends, and you know I baited

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.660
 them with fishing rods because you know they wouldn't really want to go see fish, but they'd

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.580
 want to go fishing.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:41.000
 So I had them there and so I did my count and then we talked about dams and how they

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.360
 are a rude interrupter with you know habitats and that type of thing and we just had a great

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.860
 discussion about dams and you know this one was replaced with a fish ladder which allowed

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.360
 the herring to go fishing.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.360
 So I had them there and so I did my count and then we talked about dams and how they're a rude interrupter with you know habitats and that type of thing and we just had a great discussion about dams and you know this one was replaced with a fish ladder which allowed the herring to go fishing.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.860

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.360
 So I had them there and so I did my count and then we talked about dams and you know this one was replaced with a fish ladder which allowed the herring to go fishing.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:24.240
 And the eels and whatever snuck in there as well. So we had a great time. And the next day I get a phone call from the boy's mother and she said you wouldn't believe it. The boys, well all the sixth graders had their MCAS and the open response question was name and describe a man made structure that was made of wood.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:36.240
 So I had them there and so I did my count and then we talked about dams and you know this one was replaced with a fish ladder which allowed the herring to go fishing.
