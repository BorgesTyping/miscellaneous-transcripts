00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:10,320
 So, when we first started counting herring, so it was 2012, and, you know, the rules

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,640
 were a little looser and, you know, you just had to ask permission, and you could bring

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,160
 some people to observe and see what you're doing.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,200
 So I loaded the car with kids - just my son and a couple of friends - and, you know, I

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:30,040
 baited them with fishing rods because, you know, they wouldn't really want to go see

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,560
 fish, but they'd want to go fishing.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:41,000
 So I had them there and so I did my count and then I- we talked about dams, and how they

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,360
 are a rude interrupter with, you know, habitats and that type of thing, and we just had a great

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,140
 discussion about dams and, you know, this one was replaced with a fish ladder which

10
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:59,600
 allowed the herring to migrate - and the eels, and whatever snuck in there as well.

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:08,200
 So, we had a great time, and the next day I get a phone call from the boy's mother and

12
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,240
 she said, "You wouldn't believe it.

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:18,480
 "The boys," - well, all the sixth graders - "had their MCAS and the open response question

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:26,360
 "was: 'Name and describe a man-made structure that interrupts,'" - or, they probably didn't

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:33,320
 say "interrupt", but that, you know - "'disturbs the natural ecology.'"

16
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,720
 "And, you gave them the answer, Karen!"

17
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,960
 (laughing)
