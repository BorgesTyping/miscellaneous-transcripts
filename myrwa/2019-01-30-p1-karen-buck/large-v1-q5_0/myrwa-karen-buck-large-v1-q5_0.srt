1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,200
 So, when we first started counting herring, so 2012, the rules were a little looser, and

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,980
 you just had to ask permission, and you could bring some people to observe and see what

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,980
 you're doing.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:24,740
 So, I loaded the car with kids, just my son and a couple of friends, and I baited them

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,080
 with fishing rods, because they wouldn't really want to go see fish, but they'd want to go

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,080
 fishing.

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:40,980
 So, I had them there, and so I did my count, and then we talked about dams and how they

8
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,360
 are a rude interrupter with habitats and that type of thing, and we just had a great

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,580
 discussion about dams, and this one was replaced with a fish ladder, which allowed the herring

10
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,520
 to migrate, and the eels and whatever snuck in there as well.

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:08,200
 So, we had a great time, and the next day, I get a phone call from the boy's mother,

12
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,200
 and she said, "You wouldn't believe it."

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:18,440
 The boys, well, all the sixth graders had their MCAS, and the open response question

14
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:27,560
 was, "Name and describe a man-made structure that," or they probably didn't say interrupter,

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:35,720
 "but that disturbs the natural ecology," and you gave them the answer, Karen.

16
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,800
 (laughs)
