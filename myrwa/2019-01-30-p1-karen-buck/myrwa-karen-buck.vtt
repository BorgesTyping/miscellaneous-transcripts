00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:10.320
 So, when we first started counting herring, so it was 2012, and, you know, the rules

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.640
 were a little looser and, you know, you just had to ask permission, and you could bring

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.160
 some people to observe and see what you're doing.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.200
 So I loaded the car with kids - just my son and a couple of friends - and, you know, I

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.040
 baited them with fishing rods because, you know, they wouldn't really want to go see

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.560
 fish, but they'd want to go fishing.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:41.000
 So I had them there and so I did my count and then I- we talked about dams, and how they

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.360
 are a rude interrupter with, you know, habitats and that type of thing, and we just had a great

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.140
 discussion about dams and, you know, this one was replaced with a fish ladder which

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.600
 allowed the herring to migrate - and the eels, and whatever snuck in there as well.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:08.200
 So, we had a great time, and the next day I get a phone call from the boy's mother and

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.240
 she said, "You wouldn't believe it.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.480
 "The boys," - well, all the sixth graders - "had their MCAS and the open response question

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:26.360
 "was: 'Name and describe a man-made structure that interrupts,'" - or, they probably didn't

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.320
 say "interrupt", but that, you know - "'disturbs the natural ecology.'"

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.720
 "And, you gave them the answer, Karen!"

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.960
 (laughing)
